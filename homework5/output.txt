NOTE ON TESTS: This driver code will not use any hand-made files to read and write from. It will create it on its own

=======TEST 1 ON writefile FUNCTION=========
Testing whether the writefile functions successfully creates a file and writes the pokemon data to that file.

Setting up test 1 data
Pokemon array data (5 pokemons): 
Pokemon 0:  name = Charizard        level = 46
Pokemon 1:  name = Blastoise        level = 63
Pokemon 2:  name = Mewtwo           level = 73
Pokemon 3:  name = Cubone           level = 19
Pokemon 4:  name = Gengar           level = 37

Called writefile function and is attempting to write to "myPokemon"
writefile returned 0
Successfully wrote to the file "myPokemon"


==========TEST 2 ON readfile FUNCTION==========
Testing whether the readfile function parses the file and stores the data in the pokemon array

Setting up test 2 data
Pokemon array data before reading from the file: 
Pokemon 0:  name =                  level = 0
Pokemon 1:  name =                  level = 0
Pokemon 2:  name =                  level = 0
Pokemon 3:  name =                  level = 0
Pokemon 4:  name =                  level = 0

Calling the readfile function
readfile returned 0
Successfully opened file in readfile function

Pokemon array data after attempting to read from the file: 
Pokemon 0:  name = Charizard        level = 46
Pokemon 1:  name = Blastoise        level = 63
Pokemon 2:  name = Mewtwo           level = 73
Pokemon 3:  name = Cubone           level = 19
Pokemon 4:  name = Gengar           level = 37
Checking for correct number of pokemon read from the file.
Successfully read the correct number of pokemon from the file. Expected 5 pokemon

===========TEST 3 ON writefile WITH 7 POKEMONS===========
Testing whether the writefile function will overwrite the previous file with another set of pokemons
Setting up test 3 data
Pokemon array data (7 pokemons): 
Pokemon 0:  name = Charmander       level = 13
Pokemon 1:  name = Seal             level = 27
Pokemon 2:  name = Lugia            level = 65
Pokemon 3:  name = Driftloon        level = 19
Pokemon 4:  name = Geodude          level = 28
Pokemon 5:  name = Pikachu          level = 38
Pokemon 6:  name = Staraptor        level = 47

Called writefile function with above data
Successfully wrote to file with given data


===========TEST 4 ON readfile===========
Testing that the readfile will not store more than the array can hold (max 5 pokemons) even though the file has 7 pokemon
Setting up test 4 data
Pokemon array data before reading the file (array size = 5): 
Pokemon 0:  name =                  level = 0
Pokemon 1:  name =                  level = 0
Pokemon 2:  name =                  level = 0
Pokemon 3:  name =                  level = 0
Pokemon 4:  name =                  level = 0

Called writefile function with above data
writefile returned 0
Successfully wrote to file with given data


Pokemon array data after reading the file (array size = 5): 
Pokemon 0:  name = Charmander       level = 13
Pokemon 1:  name = Seal             level = 27
Pokemon 2:  name = Lugia            level = 65
Pokemon 3:  name = Driftloon        level = 19
Pokemon 4:  name = Geodude          level = 28
